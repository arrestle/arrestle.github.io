This is the first blog posting explaining my culminating project for my [NCSU](https://www.ncsu.edu/) (North Carolina State University) [MALS](https://mals.chass.ncsu.edu/) (Master of Arts of Liberal Studies) degree.

MALS is designed as an interdisciplinary degree, and this project will use computer science techniques of data visualizations to show individuals the impact of their actions on the larger world, via the use of a website users can access on their computers or mobile devices.

I will focus on food choices, not only because this is something everyone can relate to, but also because it's we can reliably gather the data and visualize the results of various choices, within the bounds of a restaurant, by communicating with the farmers and managers involved in producing and preparing the meals on a limited menu.

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
